# Discord-Bot
start by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
Ask Alex for the bot token to drop in your .env file
Two things must be changed:
1. In bot.py you will need to change the guild_id to your testing server's id
2. In Authorization.py you will need to change admin_id to your admin role id

Ids can be obtained by enabling developer mode in discord and right clicking on the server and going into roles and right clicking on the role.
